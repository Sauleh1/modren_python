    "* OOPS's:\n",
    "    * OOPS, or More commonly called in programming terms as `\"Object Oriented Programming\"`, Allows us to sort our data and organize it.\n",
    "    * OOP's come with 2 types of methods, namely `Magic` Methods and `Dunder` Methods:\n",
    "        * Magic Methods are methods with 2 \"_\" characters before and after them.\n",
    "        * Dunder Methods are methods which do not have 2 \"_\" characters before and after them.\n",
    "        * An example of a Magic method in use:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            class Student:\n",
    "                Name = \"Sauleh\"\n",

    "# The Types of Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "* OOP's come with 4 Types, namely:\n",
    "    * `Abstraction:`\n",
    "        * Abstraction in Python is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. It's a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming   (OOP) that hides the complexity of a system, allowing users to implement methods without knowing the underlying logic. This      encapsulation of implementation details simplifies programming.\n",
    "        * An example of abstraction code is:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            class Car:\n",
    "                def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "                    self.make = make\n",
    "                    self.model = model\n",
    "                    self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "                 def drive(self):\n",

    "                tesla = Car(\"Tesla\", \"Model 3\", 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "                tesla.drive()\n",
    "                ```\n",
    "    * `Encapsulation:`\n",
    "        * Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the idea of wrapping data and themethods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent theaccidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.Those types of variables are known as `private` variables.\n",
    "        * An example of Encapsulation code in python is:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            class Person:\n",
    "                def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "                    self.__name = name\n",
    "                    self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "                def get_name(self):\n",
    "                    return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "                def get_age(self):\n",
    "                    return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "            person = Person(\"John Doe\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "            name = person.get_name()\n",
    "\n",
    "            age = person.get_age()\n",
    "\n",
    "            print(f\"The person's name is {name} and their age is {age}\")\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "    * `Inheritance:`\n",
    "        * In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit all the methods and properties from another class¹. The class being inherited from is called the base or parent class, while the class that inherits is known as the derived or child class.\n",
    "        * An example of Inheritance code in python is:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            class Animal:\n",
    "                def eat(self):\n",
    "                    print(\"The animal is eating.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "                def move(self):\n",
    "                    print(\"The animal is moving.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "                def bark(self):\n",
    "                    print(\"The dog is barking.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "            dog.eat()\n",
    "\n",
    "            dog.move()\n",
    "\n",
    "            dog.bark()\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "    * `Polymorphism:`\n",
    "        * Polymorphism in Python is a principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows methods to behave differently based on the object that is calling them. It enables a single interface to represent different types in different scenarios.\n",
    "        * An example of Inheritance code in python is:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            class Animal:\n",
    "                def speak(self):\n",
    "                    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "            class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "                def speak(self):\n",
    "                    print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "                def speak(self):\n",
    "                    print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "\n",
    "            for animal in animals:\n",
    "                animal.speak()\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Property Method of OOPS\n",
    "* In Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the `property` method is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object. This method provides a way to customize access to an attribute in a class. It allows us to add functionality like computation or validation when getting or setting the attribute's value. It also enhances the encapsulation of our code by keeping the representation of an attribute hidden from its interface, thus adhering to the principle of data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An example of code using the `property` method in python OOP's is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self._radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def radius(self):\n",
    "        return self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @radius.setter\n",
    "    def radius(self, value):\n",
    "        if value >= 0:\n",
    "            self._radius = value\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Variables in a class\n",
    "* In Python, variables are defined either in a class, or in a function, or even in procedural code:\n",
    "    * In Python, a class can have two types of variables: instance variables and class variables. Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. This means that for each object or instance of a class, the instance variables are different. They are defined inside a method and belong only to the current instance of the class. You can access them using the self keyword.\n",
    "    * On the other hand, class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are not defined inside any methods and because they are shared, they can be accessed by all instances of the class. If you change the value of a class variable, it will be reflected in all instances that access it. Class variables are often used when a specific piece of information needs to be shared across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * All class variables are always shared by all instances of the class. They also always have different names which makes them differ from each other. For example:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        class MyClass:\n",
    "            var1: str = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "            var2: int = 100\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Basic syntax of a Class\n",
    "* The basic Syntax of a class Is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class [ Class_Name ]:\n",
    "    Details     <-- Details of the class\n",
    "    Constructor     <-- To make instances of a class\n",
