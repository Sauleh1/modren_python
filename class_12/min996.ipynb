    "* OOP's:\n",
    "    * OOPS, or More commonly called in programming terms as \"Object Oriented Programming\", Allows us to sort our data and organize it.\n",
    "    * OOP's come with 2 types of methods, namely Magic Methods and Dunder Methods:\n",
    "        * Magic Methods are methods with 2 \"_\" characters befpre and after them.\n",
    "        * Dunder Methods are methods which do not have 2 \"_\" characters before and after them.\n",

    "    * OOP's come with 4 Types, namely:\n",
    "        * Abstraction:\n",
    "            * Abstraction in Python is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. It's a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming   (OOP) that hides the complexity of a system, allowing users to implement methods without knowing the underlying logic. This      encapsulation of implementation details simplifies programming.\n",
    "        * Encapsulation:\n",
    "            * Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",
    "        * Inheritance:\n",
    "            * In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit all the methods and properties from another class¹. The class being inherited from is called the base or parent class, while the class that inherits is known as the derived or child class.\n",
    "        * Polymorphisem:\n",
    "            * Polymorphism in Python is a principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows methods to behave differently based on the object that is calling them. It enables a single interface to represent different types in different scenarios.\n",
